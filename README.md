## Usage

You need Esy, you can install the beta using [npm](https://npmjs.com):

    % npm install -g esy@latest

> NOTE: Make sure `esy --version` returns at least `0.5.4` for this project to build.

Then run the `esy` command from this project root to install and build depenencies.

    % esy

Now you can run the program with `esy x Hello`
